Project Overview

This repository contains a simple time-management web project implemented using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The project was created as a college exam submission and completed within 1 hour, so the design and code are intentionally minimal and straightforward.

It is fully client-side and works by simply opening the HTML files in any browser.

Files in this repo

index.html — Main landing page / UI.

time.html — Secondary time display page.

script.js — JavaScript logic for time features and interactions.

style.css — Styling for layout and visuals.

Requirements

No special setup required.
You only need:

A modern browser (Chrome / Firefox / Edge / Safari)

(Optional) A simple local server for cleaner testing

How to run (locally)
Method 1 — Easiest

Just open index.html by double-clicking it.

Method 2 — Run with a local server

Recommended if you want consistent behaviour:

python -m http.server 8000


Then open:

http://localhost:8000/

Notes & recommendations

This is an exam-time project, so you can improve UI/UX later.

Add comments inside script.js if you continue development.

You can deploy the project using GitHub Pages for a live demo.

No backend or external library is used.
